            <p class="testimonials__text">Our wedding photographers and videographers are nearly invisible on the day of
                event, but we shure do get all the attention after, once we submit our work. We are proud to display
                nearly
                perfect scores across all of our reviewing platforms including Google and WeddingWire.

            <p class="testimonials__story">We wish we could re-live that day again!!!!!! We have met our wedding
                photographer in advance in order to discuss the concept and the ideas we had for the couple photoshoot.
                He
                did not hesitate when we asked him what would look best, and appeared very knowledgeable. We couldn’t be
                happier with our pics!

            <p class="testimonials__story">We went with the Lucky Package for our small wedding. We only invited the
                closest
                family and friends, and we were looking for photo+video coverage that would be discreet and that would
                do a
                good job capturing everyone and everything. Our photo and video guys were professional and very
                friendly,
                which is something my guests appreciated because we are usually camera-shy. So many amazing pictures,
                and
                the video is just sweet! Thank you!

            <p class="subtitle__addition">Bride and Groom, Toronto</p>
            <p class="testimonials__story">Great guys! We only got a video package with them, because unfortunately by
                the
                time we found them we already had a photographer booked. I could see that the photographer always got in
                their way, and I can’t imagine how come their videos are eventually so good, because I was sure all I’m
                gonna see is this guy and his camera. They were so professional about it, it really speaks volumes.

                    <h3 class="faq__question">WHY IS IT BETTER TO HIRE PHOTO AND VIDEO FROM ONE TEAM?</h3>
                    <p class="faq__answear">Wedding photographers and videographers are performing the same job, and to
                        do it well they need the same elements- flattering angles, good lighting, right timing.When they
                        work as a team, their working process resembles a dance where each one knows how to move, so
                        both of them get what they need. They focus on this flow instead of competing with each other
                        for the best material, as it often happens when two strangers are hired, each to do his own
                        business.

                    <h3 class="faq__question">MAY I CUSTOMISE MY PHOTO AND VIDEO POST PRODUCTION?</h3>
                    <p class="faq__answear">Most of our clients give us the full creative power over their wedding
                        photos and videos and trust that we will use our skills and knowledge to polish it to its
                        maximum potential. However, sometimes clients request a specific style of colouring or a
                        particular soundtrack for their videos, and that is fine with us.

                    </p>

                <li class="faq__item">
                    <h3 class="faq__question">WILL MY PHOTOGRAPHS AND VIDEOS LOOK THE SAME?</h3>
                    <p class="faq__answear">Yes, we colour grade our materials identically in order to maintain a
                        uniform style. Most of our clients prefer natural looking colour correction, with deep hues and
                        timeless feel to it, so that is what we strive for unless requested differently.

                <li class="faq__item">
                    <h3 class="faq__question">HOW MANY PHOTOS CAN I EXPECT?</h3>
                    <p class="faq__answear">We submit around 70-100 HQ edited photos per one hour of coverage. If it's a
                        10 hours coverage, you get around 1000 photos, but it also depends on how busy your wedding day
                        is. If you have many ceremonies, rituals and performances, you may expect this amount to double.

                <li class="faq__item">
                    <h3 class="faq__question">WHAT ARE TURNAROUND TIMES?</h3>
                    <p class="faq__answear">For photography, the turnaround is one month. We also send you around ten
                        edited pictures within two days after the wedding so you can share them with your relatives
                        right away.
                        For the video, the deadline is three months from the moment the client has chosen a soundtrack.
                        It depends on the season, but usually, we submit videos after roughly a month and a half.

                    <h3 class="faq__question">WHAT IS SO SPECIAL ABOUT YOUR SILENT COVERAGE?</h3>
                    <p class="faq__answear">We use mirrorless cameras that don't have a clicking mechanism, so our photo
                        cameras are silent. You won't hear any distracting noises during the ceremony or at any other
                        time, as well as on your video.
                        Also, it means that our cameras can take more frames per second, ensuring that we capture every
                        moment.
